# Personal Website
This webpage was the first assignment in my web dev course. The task was to create a personalized webpage. This webpage includes an about me section, with a headshot and a brief section about myself, a project page showing off some personal projects, a resume page displaying my resume, and a fun page with some of my hobbies and personal goals.

This assignment was my first forray into web development and was a unique challenge. I really enjoyed learning how to build out a website and compile a spot where I can host personal information.

This website was built with the Foundation 6 framework.
